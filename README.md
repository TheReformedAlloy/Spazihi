# Spazihi GroupMe Library
A standard framework to provide a more streamlined way to create new GroupMe bots.

## Introduction

For a while, I've had my own GroupMe bot up and running. However, I've decided to change it up a bit and make it a little bit easier for people to make their own GroupMe bots. I found the API documentation a little confusing in the beginning, and so I've taken it upon myself to hopefully make more readily available for people the ability to perform actions using the GroupMe API without having to worry about the hassle of working through its nuances.

Essentially, I've attempted to make a framework that allows an implementation of the bot to use .JSON files to implement timed messages or other execution of code, in addition to responding to messages sent in groups (the latter having not yet been implemented).
